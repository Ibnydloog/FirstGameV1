# FirstGameV1
First Attempt at my game, more coming soon hopefully
.exe file is an executable I built through pyintaller. Only runs on Windows currently.
.dmg file is coming soon 
.py has source code available for whoever wants to mess with it or make it better.
pygame used to build, must have pygame installed to edit and run
  can be done through 
      python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
    python variant changes depending on python version installed
