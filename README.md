# FirstGameV1
First Attempt at my game, more coming soon hopefully. 
.exe file is an executable I built through pyintaller. Only runs on Windows currently. 
.py has source code available for whoever wants to mess with it or make it better. 

Must have python and pygame installed to run project. 
Python can be downloaded here: https://www.python.org/downloads/ make sure correct version is installed for your device. 
Pygame can be installed following these steps: https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted . 

When putting python file and img file into a coding editor, make sure to put them both in a single folder- this way the directory is correct when running the code and all assets will load.
